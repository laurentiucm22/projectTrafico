          When applying for a traffic permit, there are certain requirements
          that you must meet that are included in the examination: requirements
          for professional knowledge, solid establishment, good reputation and
          financial resources. Important to remember is to confirm your
          application for a traffic permit by the company's company signer or
          CEO.
